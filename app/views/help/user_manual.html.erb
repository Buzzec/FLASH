                <p>Purpose: The events page allows you to create and manage events for all users</p>
                <p>Actions: What can you do with the events page?
                <br/>
                "Add New Event" - This button takes you to a form that will allow you to create an event.
                <br/>
                "Previous/Next" - These links will take you to the next or previous month to view future or past events.
                <br/>
                *Clicking a day* - When you click on a day with events, you will be able to see the list of events for that day.
                If you click on a day without events, you will be given the opportunity to create an event for that day.
                <br/>
                *Clicking a specific event* - When you click on a specific event after clicking on the day, you will have the options to RSVP, Attend, or Delete the Event
                <br/>
                "RSVP" - RSVP is a short way of asking if you are coming to an event. This is how you can help the event planners prepare for an event.
